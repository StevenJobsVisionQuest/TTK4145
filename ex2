Atomic operation: An operation in which the processor both reads and writes in the same bus operation. Thus disabling  any other
processor or I/O device from writing or reading memory until it is complete

Semaphore: A semaphore is a variable used to control multiple processes access to a commen variable/function/adress space in a concurrent
system. A counting semaphore simply holds the number of available resources and incremnents/decrements whenever a process "leaves" 
or "enters" the shared resource

Mutex/Mutual exclusion is a property of concurrency control preventing race conditions. It requireds that one thread of execution
never enters its critical section at the same time as another thread of execution does so

Critical section: Parts of the program where shared resources is accessed by several processes/threads are called the critical section
